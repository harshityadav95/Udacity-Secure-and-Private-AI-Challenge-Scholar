Udacity:Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge Nanodegree Program

Welcome to the Udacity-Secure-and-Private-AI-Challenge-Scholar wiki!

### Projects :
* [The OpenMined Project for Secure and Private Ai](https://www.openmined.org)

### Day-1
Notes : 
 
#### Section 1 
Welcome Note and Intro about the Author  

#### Section 2
About PyTorch and this lesson  

#### [Deep Learning Frameworks](https://youtu.be/SJldOOs4vB8)
- Tensorflow powered by Google ,Tensorboard , Tensorflow lite
- PyTorch powered by Facebook, easy to debug, Modular, TensorBoardX
- Caffe2+Pytorch is similar to TensorflowLite

### Keras : [Explanation])(https://youtu.be/j_pJmXJwMLA) 
- Keras is an Interface that wraps up high level frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano , CNTK 
- How it Works , You Define it -> Compile it -> Fit Network -> Evaluate Network -> Make Prediction
-Easiest way to get started followed by PyTorch


### ....
- CNTK : Microsoft (Cognitive tool kit),No Convential Open Source License  
- MXNet: Mixed Programming paradigm (Imperative +Declarative)
- Chainer : Supported by IBM , Intel 
- DL4J : Machine Learning for JAVA World
- ONIX : Open Neural Network Exchange Format (Facebook + Microsoft) for Interoperability.

Takeaway
- For Beginners use Keras
- For Production on GCP- TensorFlow
- For Research -Pytorch , SONNET
- For Azure -MXNet
- FOr Java -DL4J
- FOr Ios -CoreML


##### About [Facebook PyTorch Framework](https://pytorch.org/)
- Pytorch was made from Deep Learning Framework Torch which used the LUA Programming Language
- LUA has a high entry barrier, dosent have Modularity
- Its Impletmentation in Pythone made it call as PyTorch
##### Feature One (Imperative Programming)
- Difference between Imperative and Declarative Programming
- Imperative Programming : Performs computation as you type it (much of Python),more effecient due to safe value reusability 
- Symbolic Programming : Generate Symbolic Graph and Computation perform at the end of function (C++)
- Tensorflow uses Symbolic Programming
##### Feature Two (Dynamic Computation Graphing)
- PyTOrch is defined by Run, System Generate the Graph at the Run Time,easy to debug , input is dynamic , Best Suited for Researchers
-Dynamic Graphs are build at runtime which lets use us standard Python Statement
- TensorFlow, System Generate the whole graph before running it ,used for distributed compution, and Production and is best suited for Beginners


* Tensors : the Data Structure of PyTorch
* NumPy : [NumPy Explained](https://youtu.be/Tkv45wgxlEU) Its a Wrapper around C , Fortran Class , array and Matrices implementation similar to MATLAB
